# Project Status Summary

### Project Status: MVP Complete

All planned tasks for the Minimum Viable Product (MVP), from initial bootstrapping to final polishing, have been completed. The project is now a functional command-line application that assists users in drafting emails from raw text or PDF files.

### Key Features Implemented

The project was developed across four major milestones:

*   **M0: Bootstrap:** The foundational project structure, dependencies, and an interactive command-line shell were established.
*   **M1: Core Pipeline (Text):** The core email processing workflow was built. The system can take a block of text, use an LLM to extract key information and a summary, and then generate an initial email draft.
*   **M2: Features & UX:** The application was enhanced with key features, including:
    *   **PDF Parsing:** The ability to process PDF files in addition to plain text.
    *   **Draft Refinement:** Users can provide feedback in a conversational manner to iteratively refine the generated draft.
    *   **Session Management:** The shell maintains a session history, allowing for multi-turn interactions.
*   **M3: Polish & Ship:** The application was made more robust with:
    *   **Storage Options:** Drafts can be saved to a local file or uploaded to an AWS S3 bucket.
    *   **Error Handling:** The processing graph includes a dedicated error-handling node to manage exceptions gracefully.
    *   **Test Coverage:** The codebase has over 80% test coverage, ensuring reliability.

### High-Level Architecture

The application's logic is built around a `langgraph` state machine. User input is processed through a series of nodes that progressively enrich a central `GraphState` object.

Here is a simplified diagram of the core workflow:

```mermaid
graph TD
    subgraph "Input"
        A[User provides Text or PDF Path]
    end

    subgraph "Processing Pipeline"
        B(parse_input)
        C(extract_and_summarize)
        D(generate_initial_draft)
        E(refine_draft)
        F(save_draft)
        G(handle_error)
    end

    subgraph "Output"
        H[Display Draft to User]
        I[Save Draft to File/S3]
    end

    A --> B
    B --> C
    C --> D
    D --> H
    H -- User Feedback --> E
    E --> H
    H -- Save Command --> F
    F --> I

    B -- on error --> G
    C -- on error --> G
    D -- on error --> G
    E -- on error --> G
    F -- on error --> G
```

### Known Issues

*   **Failing CLI Tests:** There is a persistent issue where the tests for the interactive shell ([`tests/test_cli.py`](tests/test_cli.py)) are failing. The `typer` test runner is not correctly interpreting the application's exit code. While the application itself functions correctly when run manually, these tests are currently unreliable and need to be fixed.

### Next Steps

With the MVP complete, the next steps would typically involve:
1.  Resolving the failing CLI tests.
2.  Beginning work on the next set of features as defined in a new project plan.
3.  Packaging the application for easier distribution.

# Roo Rules for the Conversational Email Assistant

This project is guided by a detailed architectural plan. All development activities must align with this plan to ensure consistency and quality.

## 1. Architectural Adherence

- All new code, including modules, classes, and functions, MUST align with the components, responsibilities, and folder structure defined in `docs/Architectural_Plan.md`.
- Before implementing a feature, verify that your approach is consistent with the documented architecture.

## 2. Task-Driven Development

- All development work MUST be traceable to a specific task in the `project.todo.json` file.
- Commit messages SHOULD reference the ID of the task they are addressing (e.g., `feat(M1.2): Implement parse_input node`).

## 3. Definition of Done

- A task is only considered complete when all of its "definition_of_done" criteria, as specified in `project.todo.json`, have been met. This includes writing tests and documentation where required.

## 4. Plan Before Code

- If a proposed feature or change deviates from or is not covered by the `docs/Architectural_Plan.md`, the plan MUST be updated and reviewed before implementation begins.
- This ensures the documentation remains the single source of truth for the project's design.

## 1. Architectural Adherence

- All new code, including modules, classes, and functions, MUST align with the components, responsibilities, and folder structure defined in `docs/Architectural_Plan.md`.
- Before implementing a feature, verify that your approach is consistent with the documented architecture.
- refer also to guardrails.md

## 2. Task-Driven Development

- All development work MUST be traceable to a specific task in the `project.todo.json` file.

## 3. Definition of Done

- A task is only considered complete when all of its "definition_of_done" criteria, as specified in `project.todo.json`, have been met. This includes writing tests and documentation where required.

## 4. Plan Before Code

- If a proposed feature or change deviates from or is not covered by the `docs/Architectural_Plan.md`, the plan MUST be updated and reviewed before implementation begins.

## 5. Development Environment

- The development environment is Windows. All shell commands MUST be compatible with Windows CMD or PowerShell.
- chain commands using semicolons, e.g. "cmd1; cmd2; cmd3"
